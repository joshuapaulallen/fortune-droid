Fortune Twitter
---------------

This is a tiny, li'l pet project to play with various tools.

### What does it do?

This is still a work in progress, but eventually, Fortune Twitter will periodically or on-demand semi-amusing "fortunes" (similar to [the unix program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix))) and publish them to Twitter.

### Credits

Fortunes are retrieved from [an API](https://helloacm.com/fortune/).
